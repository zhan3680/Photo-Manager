1. The first time you use this program, you need to enter the path to which
you want to store the data, called "root". Root will look like "C:\xxx" in Windows. After this, every time you open the 
program, you do not need to re-enter this path. The configuration file will also 
be created there. After the first time, if you want to change the root, you can
use File->modify database;
p.s Root (aka database directory) is the place where tags will be stored.
2. After step1, a new window called open directory will show up. You shall 
then enter a path where your image files are stored, then pressing the button 
to go to that directory.(you can open specific directory anytime using Fil->open directory) (Directory looks like "C:\xxx")
3. In the directory, you can rename, move or open the attribute of the image.
To do this, you always need to first select a certain image.
4. In rename window, you have a variaty of thing to pick from if you have previously added tags to the global tag pool. Of course, the first time user will not have that.
In order to add tags to the global tag pool, go to the very first window that program have, on the top left corner click "File", then "TagManage".
Then you have the ability to add/remove tag from the global tag pool that is persistant.
5. You can also search image using the searchbox. Use @less tag to search! (Like search with "January" instead of "!January")
6. History also works, beware that you need to pick something first to make everything work!




warning: 1. you should not have two files of the same name(name without tag)(E.g. test.png and test @x.png)
2.upon searching image by tags, you don't need to enter "@" before tag name;
